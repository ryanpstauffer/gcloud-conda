# gcloud-conda

Dockerfile for a base environment image with conda (Python 3) and gcloud (requiring Python 2.7) installed.

## What's the point?

At work, we do a lot of projects on Google Cloud Platform.

It was a bit painful getting a stable, lightweight base image for Python deployments that needed to use Google Cloud Platform resources.

_Hopefully this saves others some pain._
